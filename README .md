# Rental Property Prices Prediction

## Problem Statement:

In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions canhelp landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed rental decisions, and property
management companies optimize their portfolio management.

The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven model that predicts the rental price ofresidential properties based on relevant features. By analyzing historical rental data and property attributes, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions.

### Libraries/Modules needed for the project!

- Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
- matplotlib, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)
- streamlit

## Solution

The solution includes the following steps:

Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.

Transforming the data into a suitable format and performing any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.

Developing a machine learning regression model which predicts the continuous variable 'Rental_Price' using the Lasso which give the beter accuracy score.

Creating a Streamlit page where you can insert each column value and get the Rental_Price predicted value of house.


## Getting Started


Install the required libraries.

Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run app.py.

Enter the values for each column to get the Rental_Price predicted value of house.
